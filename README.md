# CSharp FizzBuzz TDD Implementation

This is a simple exercise to test your understanding of TDD and pair programming. The goal is to implement the FizzBuzz game in C#.

The FizzBuzz game is a simple number game where you count up from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, you say "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, you say "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, you say "FizzBuzz".

For example, the first 15 numbers would be:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz

There is also a console game that you can play. It is a simple console application that will prompt you to enter an interval of numbers so you must guess the output of the FizzBuzz game for that interval.
